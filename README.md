# Exploring Microplastics in the Atlantic Ocean: Data Analysis and Insights  [in progress]
**By Natalia Boaventura**  

## Problem Statement  
Microplastics are a growing environmental challenge, significantly impacting marine ecosystems and biodiversity. These tiny plastic particles accumulate in oceans, threatening marine life and potentially entering the food chain. Understanding the distribution, sources, and impact of microplastics is critical for protecting aquatic environments and developing strategies to mitigate plastic pollution.  

## Objective  
This project focuses on analyzing the "Marine Microplastics" dataset from Kaggle to:  
1. Explore microplastic concentrations, collection locations, and sampling methods.  
2. Identify patterns and correlations between microplastics and environmental factors such as water temperature, pollution levels, and geographical location.  
3. Provide actionable insights to support efforts in improving water quality and protecting coastal ecosystems.  

## Methodology  [in progress]
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:  
   - Handle missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers.  
   - Ensure the data is ready for analysis and visualization.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Visualize data to identify patterns and trends.  
   - Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to uncover insights.  
3. **Correlation Analysis**:  
   - Investigate relationships between microplastic concentrations and environmental factors such as temperature, location, and pollution indicators.    

## Project Files  
- **Notebook**: A detailed Python analysis of the dataset, including data cleaning, visualization, and insights.  
- **Dataset Source**: [Kaggle - Marine Microplastics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/william2020/marine-microplastics).  

## Conclusion  [in progress]
This project provides valuable insights into the issue of marine microplastics, offering data-driven recommendations for addressing the challenges posed by plastic pollution. By raising awareness and informing policies, we can contribute to safeguarding marine ecosystems for future generations.  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and required libraries installed (see `requirements.txt`).  
3. Run the notebook to explore the analysis.
