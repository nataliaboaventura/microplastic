# Exploring Microplastics in the Atlantic Ocean: Data Analysis and Insights  
**By Natalia Boaventura**  

## 🌊 Problem Statement  
Microplastics are a growing environmental challenge, significantly impacting marine ecosystems and biodiversity. These tiny plastic particles accumulate in oceans, threatening marine life and potentially entering the food chain. Understanding the distribution, sources, and impact of microplastics is critical for protecting aquatic environments and developing strategies to mitigate plastic pollution.  

## 🎯 Objective  
This project focuses on analyzing the "Marine Microplastics" dataset from Kaggle to:  
1. Explore microplastic concentrations, collection locations, and sampling methods.  
2. Identify patterns and correlations between microplastics and environmental factors such as water temperature, pollution levels, and geographical location.  
3. Provide actionable insights to support efforts in improving water quality and protecting coastal ecosystems.  

## 🛠️ Methodology  
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:  
   - Handle missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers.  
   - Ensure the data is ready for analysis and visualization.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Visualize data to identify patterns and trends.  
   - Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to uncover insights.  
3. **Correlation Analysis**:  
   - Investigate relationships between microplastic concentrations and environmental factors such as temperature, location, and pollution indicators.  

## 📊 Key Insights  
1. **Microplastic Distribution**:  
   - Coastal areas show higher concentrations of microplastics, likely due to human activities.  
   - Remote ocean regions exhibit lower but non-negligible concentrations.  

2. **Sampling Methods and Accuracy**:  
   - Methods using finer mesh sizes detect higher microplastic concentrations, indicating variability in sampling effectiveness.  

3. **Environmental Factors**:  
   - Preliminary correlations suggest that areas with higher water temperatures and pollution levels tend to have higher concentrations of microplastics.  

## 🌐 Recommendations  
1. **Policy Interventions**:  
   - Strengthen policies to reduce plastic waste entering oceans, particularly in regions with high microplastic concentrations.  
2. **Future Research**:  
   - Combine microplastic data with broader ecological datasets for more comprehensive analyses.  
   - Explore the effects of microplastics on marine species and human health.  
3. **Public Awareness**:  
   - Use insights to educate communities about the impact of plastic pollution and promote sustainable practices.
